<h2>Flora in Hemis National Park</h2><br>
<img src="hemis-national-park.jpg">
<p><h4>Hemis National Park does not receive much rainfall throughout the year, as it is located in the rain shadow area of the Himalayas. Hence, the park is dotted with dry forests, with fir being present at lower altitudes.<br>
  
  The most commonly found trees are alpine and steppe, with its lower areas being dominated by plant species which require very less moisture including juniper, fir & dry birch. The park is also home to several rare and endangered medicinal plants.</h4></p><br>
